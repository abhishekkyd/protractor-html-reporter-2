This package is inspired by [protractor-html-reporter](https://github.com/etxebe/protractor-html-reporter) which developed based upon inspiration of [cucumber-html-report](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cucumber-html-reporter).

You can use this package to generate HTML report for Protractor test execution with pie charts based on xml file with tests results. For generating xml file with tests results you can use  [jasmine-reporters] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-reporters).   
This reporter can also display screenshots taken on test failure. To get the screenshots you can use [jasmine2-protractor-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine2-protractor-utils) module.

How to use
----------------------------------
* Converting the xml file to html
   ```javascript
    var HTMLReport = require('protractor-html-reporter-2');

	testConfig = {
                reportTitle: 'Protractor Test Execution Report',
                outputPath: './',
                outputFilename: 'ProtractorTestReport',
                screenshotPath: './screenshots',
                testBrowser: browserName,
                browserVersion: browserVersion
            };
    new HTMLReport().from('xmlresults.xml', testConfig);
    ```

* Using with protractor conf.js file

    ```javascript	
    //HTMLReport called once tests are finished
    onComplete: function() {
         var browserName, browserVersion;
         var capsPromise = browser.getCapabilities();

         capsPromise.then(function (caps) {
            browserName = caps.get('browserName');
            browserVersion = caps.get('version');
            platform = caps.get('platform');

            var HTMLReport = require('protractor-html-reporter-2');

			testConfig = {
                reportTitle: 'Protractor Test Execution Report',
                outputPath: './',
                outputFilename: 'ProtractorTestReport',
                screenshotPath: './screenshots',
                testBrowser: browserName,
                browserVersion: browserVersion,
                modifiedSuiteName: false,
                screenshotsOnlyOnFailure: true,
                testPlatform: platform
            };
            new HTMLReport().from('xmlresults.xml', testConfig);
        });
     }
     ```

* In order to obtain results in xml file you can use [jasmine-reporters](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-reporters) module:

    ```javascript
    var jasmineReporters = require('jasmine-reporters');
    jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new jasmineReporters.JUnitXmlReporter({
        consolidateAll: true,
        savePath: './',
        filePrefix: 'xmlresults'
    }));
    ```
	
* In order to obtain screenshots on failure you can use this piece of code (you have to put it in onPrepare). The directory with screenshots must be in the same location as html report file (e.g. html file is in report directory so screenshots files must be in directory /report/screenshots/).

	```javascript
	var fs = require('fs-extra');
	
	fs.emptyDir('screenshots/', function (err) {
            console.log(err);
        });

        jasmine.getEnv().addReporter({
            specDone: function(result) {
                if (result.status == 'failed') {
                    browser.getCapabilities().then(function (caps) {
                        var browserName = caps.get('browserName');

                        browser.takeScreenshot().then(function (png) {
                            var stream = fs.createWriteStream('screenshots/' + browserName + '-' + result.fullName+ '.png');
                            stream.write(new Buffer(png, 'base64'));
                            stream.end();
                        });
                    });
                }
            }
        });
	```
* Or you can use [jasmine2-protractor-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine2-protractor-utils) module to get the screenshots:

	```javascript
	//In exports.config put this:
    plugins: [{
        package: 'jasmine2-protractor-utils',
        disableHTMLReport: true,
        disableScreenshot: false,
        screenshotPath:'./screenshots',
        screenshotOnExpectFailure:false,
        screenshotOnSpecFailure:true,
        clearFoldersBeforeTest: true
      }],
      ```
If you want to display your screenshots on report you have to pass testBrowser (it's the name of the browser) in testConfig object, because the screenshot's names are in format "browserName-*.png" (e.g. "chrome-*.png").

Options
----------------------------------      
* reportTitle  
The report title displayed in generated html report.  
* outputPath  
The path where to write html report.
* outputFilename  
The name of html report file (without .html).
* screenshotPath  
The path where to look for screenshots (the path must be in the same location as html file report e.g. if html file report is in location /report/test-report.html the screenshots must be placed in directory /report/screenshots/.
* testBrowser   
The name of browser on which the tests were executed. It's necessary if you want to display screenshots in your report.
* browserVersion   
The version of the browser.
*  modifiedSuiteName (bool) default: false  
It says if suite names were changed at conf.js level. The suite names can be changed using 'jasmine-reporters' module and using modifySuiteName option. If we change the suite names this will also affect the names of screenshots we are looking for. If modifiedSuiteName is set to true the reporter will remove from the suite name the prefix and a dot (e.g. "firefox.") in order to find correct screenshot name. Unfortunately, the reporter will handle such situation only if we change suite name to "browserName.TestSuiteName" form.
* screenshotsOnlyOnFailure (bool) default: true   
To display screenshots only in testcases that failed. Default value is "true".
* testPlatform 
The name of platform on which the tests were executed.

Credits
----------------------------------
Thanks to [@etxebe](https://github.com/etxebe) and all credits to developers of [protractor-html-reporter](https://github.com/etxebe/protractor-html-reporter) for nice protractor reporting. The protractor-html-reporter-2 is liitle bit html enhancement of this one. I've just fixed few things, some thing were added from pull requests and this reporter is still based on xml file.
